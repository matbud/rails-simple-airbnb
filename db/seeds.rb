# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 5.times do
#   Flat.create!(
#     name: Faker::GreekPhilosophers.name,
#     address: Faker::Address.full_address,
#     description: Faker::GreekPhilosophers.quote,
#     price_per_night: (25..100).step(5).to_a.sample,
#     number_of_guests: rand(2..5)
